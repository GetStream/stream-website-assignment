# Dashboard & Chat

The goal for this at-home assignment is to build a React app that resembles the following two images closely. The idea is that we can see how you work from an image to an actual product. You'll implement two pages of this hospital app. The first being a global dashboard and the second a page where you can chat with doctors.

## Requirements

- Follow the design as closely as possible
- Implement "Dashboard" & "Dr. Profiles"
- Use Stream Chat to implement the "Dr. Profiles" page ([use our free trial account](https://getstream.io/chat/trial/))
- Style the different states (hover, active, etc.)

## Notes
- For images placeholders/screenshots of the design can be used
- For icons use an open source library like fontawesome

## Deliverable

- A public repository we can pull and run `yarn; yarn start` to be able to view the project

## Deadline

- There isn't one :)
- But please let us know what your estimate is of when you expect to hand it in.

## Bonus points

- Use React and make Components
- Add animations
- Use a design system
